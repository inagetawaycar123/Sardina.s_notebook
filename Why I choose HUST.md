 Thanks for giving me the precious opportunity to speak here, and please let me start with a catchy song----*Sunshine*.

>Running through this strange life
>Chasing all them green lights
>Throwing off the shades for a little bit of sunshine
>Hit me with them good vibes
>Pictures on my phone live
>Everything is so fire
>A little bit of sunshine

Immersed in the refreshing lyrics, have you ever felt like yourself speeding along the Yujia Lu, whistling all the way, and that carefree feeling just wrapping you around?

That's what I cherish most about HUST! The boundless campus endows me with the freedom to explore,  while the diverse choices in all areas of life set my mind unrestrained. What's more, the strong study culture also distinguishes the university from others.  And that is HUST, where infinite possibilities take root and thrive.

Above all is the broad campus, with every spot to savor and every corner to admire .It takes over an hour to walk around all of it, and along the way, elegant gardens, vibrant sports areas and cozy living quarters unfold. Blending academic vitality with a tranquil atmosphere, it accommodates tens of thousands of teachers and students. It is this land, both broad and lively, that paves the way for growth, allowing every student to develop freely.

Then it comes to the diverse choices in life. From the different courses to choose from, to all kinds of research topics to pursue, and then to the alternative between work and graduate school. We are empowered to judge by ourselves, make our own choices, and fully take the initiative. And that is HUST. There is no single right answer, but only numerous broad paths to embark on.

Most importantly, the solid and rigorous academic spirit gives weight to our freedom. "Virtue and Knowledge, Truth and Innovation"----the school motto is more than just black words on the wall, but a maxim engraved in my heart. It shows the principles of how to conduct oneself, handle matters, and pursue knowledge.

HUST isn’t just a university; it’s a place where our carefree spirits meet purposeful growth, where every "strange life" chapter is filled with good vibes and fiery dreams. This is why I choose HUST, and this is where I’ll keep chasing that little bit of sunshine—now and always.
